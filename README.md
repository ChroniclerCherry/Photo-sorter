# Photo-sorter
This small script will move all photos from a given source directory to a given
destination directory, while sorting them into folders by year and date. Videos
will be placed unsorted into a seperate folder

Options are included to either copy files while sorting, or moving files while
sorting. Moving files will delete directories as the source folders become
 empty

There is an option for a stricter check of identical photos which will slow the
process down

A log of all activites will be recorded at Photo Sorter log.txt
